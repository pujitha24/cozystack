# Unit tests for hack/select-e2e.sh
#
# cozytest.sh's awk parser recognizes only @test blocks and a bare `}` on its
# own line; there is no bats `run` or `$status`. Each test runs as a shell
# function under `set -eu -x`, so assertions are direct shell tests that exit
# non-zero on failure. setup()/teardown() are not honored — each test creates
# and cleans its own scratch dir.
#
# "Full suite" is asserted as an exact match against the suite list derived the
# same way select-e2e.sh derives it, not as a count: a threshold like `-gt 5`
# passes just as happily on a wrong set that happens to be large, and did hide
# two suites that the graph could not reach.
#
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/select-e2e_test.bats
